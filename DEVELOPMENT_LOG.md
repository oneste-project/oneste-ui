# Development Log

## 2025-07-25

### Initial Setup & Design
- Successfully resolved Tailwind CSS configuration issues after a clean project restart.
- Implemented an initial futuristic design for the `spec.md` content in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Integrated a techy background animation using `tsparticles`.
- Confirmed that all styles are applying correctly.

### Documentation
- Created `DETAILED_SPEC.md` for comprehensive application information.
- Updated `spec.md` with a reference to `DETAILED_SPEC.md`.

### Content & Feature Updates (v2)
- Updated `DETAILED_SPEC.md` to reflect the new decentralized, crypto-focused vision (Etherlink, Tez staking, smart contracts).
- Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to align with the new theme:
    - Updated main heading and tagline.
    - Updated main descriptive paragraphs.
    - Updated "How It Works" cards to reflect new flow and terminology.

## Important: Plan for App Completion

Based on `readme-spec.md` and the current setup, here's the detailed plan to complete the Oneste application:

### Phase 1: Core Blockchain Integration & Wallet Connection
- **Objective:** Establish a connection to the Etherlink blockchain and enable wallet interaction.
- **Actions:**
    - Installed necessary libraries: `ethers`, `wagmi`, `@wagmi/core`, `@tanstack/react-query`, and `viem`.
    - Configured Wagmi in `src/app/layout.tsx` with placeholder Etherlink chain details.
    - Implemented a "Connect Wallet" component (`src/components/ConnectWallet.tsx`) and integrated it into `src/app/page.tsx`.
    - Successfully implemented wallet connection and disconnection.

### Phase 2: Proposal Display & Staking UI
- **Objective:** Present proposals to the user and allow them to stake XTZ.
- **Actions:**
    - Created `src/components/DebateList.tsx` to display mock debates.
    - Integrated `DebateList` into `src/app/page.tsx`.
    - Added staking input field and "Stake XTZ" button to each debate card in `src/components/DebateList.tsx`.
    - Implemented state management for staking input and a placeholder `handleStake` function.
    - Resolved "uncontrolled to controlled" input warning in `DebateList.tsx`.
    - Refactored `DebateList.tsx` into `DebateList.tsx` and `DebateCard.tsx` to manage per-debate staking state and UI.
    - Implemented placeholder staking logic using `useWriteContract` and `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` for future smart contract integration.

### Phase 3: Voting Mechanism UI
- **Objective:** Enable users to cast their votes on debates.
- **Actions:
    - Implemented clear voting buttons for each option within a debate in `DebateCard.tsx`.
    - Implemented placeholder voting logic using `useWriteContract` and `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` for future smart contract integration.
    - Updated the UI to reflect the user's vote and the current vote counts (if available from the contract).

### Phase 4: Reward Display & Claiming UI
- **Objective:** Show earned rewards and provide a mechanism to claim them.
- **Actions:
    - Create a section to display the user's current XTZ rewards and in-game points.
    - Implement a "Claim Rewards" button.
    - Implement the claiming logic: Call the reward claiming function on the smart contract, handling transaction signing and confirmation.

### Phase 5: Design Refinements & User Experience
- **Objective:** Enhance the visual appeal, mobile-friendliness, and clarity for non-technical players.
- **Actions:
    - Refine the existing Tailwind CSS to align with a "clean, game-themed aesthetic." This includes typography, color palettes, and component styling.
    - Ensure all UI components are responsive and mobile-friendly.
    - Add clear visual feedback for blockchain interactions (e.g., loading spinners for pending transactions, success/failure notifications).
    - Implement tooltips or simple explanations for blockchain-specific terms (e.g., "gas fees," "staking").

### Phase 6: Error Handling & Testing Considerations
- **Objective:** Implement robust error handling and provide guidance for testing.
- **Actions:
    - Implement specific error handling for common blockchain issues (e.g., "Insufficient XTZ," "User rejected transaction," "Network error"). Display user-friendly messages.
    - Add a dedicated section (e.g., in `DETAILED_SPEC.md` or a new `TESTING.md`) with instructions on how to test the UI on Etherlinkâ€™s testnet, including how to obtain testnet XTZ and connect a wallet.
